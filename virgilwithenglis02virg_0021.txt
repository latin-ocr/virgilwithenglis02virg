AENEID BOOK VII

⁸¹ But the king, troubled by the portent, visits the
oracle of Faunus, his prophetie sire, and consults the
groves beneath high Albunea, which, mightiest of
fores’cs,1 echoes with hallowed fountain, and breathes
forth from her darkness a deadly vapour. Hence
the tribes of Italy and all the Oenotriam land seek
responses in days of doubt3 hither the priestess
brings the offerings, and as she lies under the silent
night on the outspread fleeces of slaughtered sheep
and woos slumber, she sees many phantoms ssitting in
wondrous wise, hears voices manifold, holds converse
with the gods, and speaks with Acheron in lowest
Avernus. Here then, also, King Latinus himself,
seeking an answer, duly slaughtered a hundred woolly
sheep, and lay couched on their hides and outspread
fleeces. Suddenly a voice came from the deep grove:
“Seek not, O my son, to ally thy daughter in Latin
wedlock, and put no faith in the bridal-chamber
prepared. Strangers shall come, to be thy sons,
whose blood shall exalt our name to the stars, and
the children of whose race shall behold, where the
circling sun looks on either ocean,2 the whole world
roll obedient beneath their feet.” This answer of
his father Faunus, and-the warning he gave in the
silent night, Latinus keeps not shut within his own
lips; but Rumour, flitting far and wide, had already
borne the tidings through the Ausonian cities, when
the sons of Laomedon moored their ships to the
river’s grassy bank.

¹⁰⁷ Aeneas, and his chief captains and fair Iulus,

¹ Albunea is here identified with the forest. Situated at
or near Laurentum, this must be different from the Albunea
of Horace, carm. 1. 7, 12, which is a cascade at Tibur.

Β i.e. in East and lVest3 tho Oceau being conceived as
flowing round the earth.
