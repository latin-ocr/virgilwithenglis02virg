raee since Troy's towers fell, nor have Ι joysul re-
membrance of the ills of old. 'l'he gifts that ye
bring me from your country's bounds take rather to

king, first calling on heaven, from his high throne
begins:

on our country’s weal, Ι both could wisi), and it had
been better; not to convene a council at such an
hour, when the foe is seated at our walls. A war
unblest, O my countrymen, we are wagmg with a
race divine, with men unconquered ; no battles wear-y
