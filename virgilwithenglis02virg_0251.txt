AENEID BOOK XI

altars high with gifts; we, in sorrow, attend with
bootless rites the liseless son, who no more owes
aught to any gods of heaven. Unhappy! thou wilt
behold the bitter funeral of thy son! Is this our
return, our awaited triumph ? Is this my sure pledge ?
Yet shall not thine eyes, Evander, look on one routed
with shameful wounds nor shalt thou, his father, pray
for a death accursed, because thy son is saved.1 Ah
me! how great a protection is lost to thee, Ausonia,
how great to thee, Iiilus !''

⁵⁹ His lamentation ended, he bids them raise the
piteous corpse, and sends a thousand rnen chosen
from his whole host to attend the last rite and share
the father’s tears—scant solace for grief so vast, but
due to a father's sorrow. Others in haste plait the
wicker-frame of a soft bier with arbute shoots and
oaken twigs, and shroud the high-piled couch with
leafy canopy. Here they lay the youth aloft 011 his
rustic bed, like to a flower culled by maiden's finger,
be it of tender violet or drooping hyacinth, whose
sheen and native grace not yet have faded, but no
more does its mother earth give strength and nurture.
Then Aeneas brought forth two robes, stiffwith gold
and purple, which Sidonian Dido, delighting in the
toil, had once herself with her own hands wrought
for him, interweaving the web with threads of gold.
Of these he sadly drapes one round the youth as a
last honour, and in its covering veils those locks the
fire shall claim; withal heaps up many a prize from
the Laurentiue fray,2 and bids the spoils be borne in

¹ The son’s dishonour would make an otherwise dreaded
death welcome to the father. Some think that it is the son's
death for which the father is supposed to pray.

² Laurentum was the capital of the Latian forces led by
Turnus.
