AENEID BOOK IX

of battle seizes on their souls. Pandarus, when he
sees his brother’s fallen form, sees how fortune stands,
and what chance sways the day, with mighty effort
pushes with his broad shoulders and swings the gate
round on its hinge, leaving many a comrade shut
outside the walls in the cruel fray3 but others he
encloses with himself, welcoming them as on they
rush. Madman! not to have seen the Rutulian
prince bursting in aniid the thrmig, and wantonly to
have shut him within the town, like a monstrous 'ciger
among the helpless herds. Sti-aightway a new light
flashed from Turnus’ eyes and his 311110111- rang terri-
bly3 the blood-red plumes quiver on his erest, and
lightnings shoot glealning from his shield. In sud-
den dismay the sons ofAcneas recognize that hateful
form and those giant limbs. Then huge Pandarus
springs forward, and, blazing with wrath for his
brother’s death, eries: “This is not Amata's brida]
palace, nor is it midmost Ardea, holding Turnus
within his native walls. A foelnan’s camp thou
seest; no chance is there to escape hencc.'’ To him
Turnus, smiling with untroubled mood: “Begin, if
thy beart has aught of courage, and close with me:
that here too an Achilles has been found shalt thou
bear word to Priam.’' He ended; the other, striving
with all his might, hurls his spear, rough with knots
and unpeeled bark. The winds received it; Saturnian
Juno turned aside the coming blow, and the spear
lodges in the gate. “ But not froin this weapon, that
my right arni wields amain, shalt thou escape3 for
not such is he who brings weapon and wound.'' So
saying, he rises high upon his uplifted sword ; the steel
cleaves the brow in twain full between the temples,
and with ghastly wound severs the beardless cheeks.
