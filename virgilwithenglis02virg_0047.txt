⁴¹4⁵ At such words Allecto blazed forth in fury.
But even as the youth spoke, a sudden tremor seized
his lhnbs, and his eyes were set in sear; so many are
the Fury‘s hissing snakes, so monstrous the features
that unfold themselves. Then, rolling her flaming
eyes, she thrust him back, as he faltered and was
fain to say more, rem-ed two snakes from her tresses,
sounded her whip, and spoke further with rabid lips ε
“Behold me, enfeebled by deeay, whom old aget
barren of truth, amid the feuds of kings, mocks with
vain alarml Look on this! I am come srom the
home of the Dread Sisters, and in my hand 1 bear
war and death.''

4⁵⁶ So saying, she hurled at the youth a torch, and
fixed in his breast the brand, smoking with lurid
light. A monstrous terror brol-ze his sleep, and the
sweat, bursting forth from all his frame, drenched
bone and limb. For arms he madly shrieks; arms he
seeks in couch and chamber3 lust of the sword rages
in him, the accursed frenzy of war, and resentment
crowning all: even as when flaming sticks, loud
crackhng, are heaped under the ribs of a billowing
cauldron, and the waters dance with the heat3 within
seethes the liquid flood, steaxning and bubbling up
high with f0am3 and now the wave contains itself
no longer, and the black smoke soars alost. There-
fore, profaning peace, he orders his chief warriors to
march upon Latinus, and bids arms be made ready.
“Defend Italy,¹’ he crieS‚ “drive the foe from her
bounds; Icome, a match for both Teucrians and
Latins.” When thus he spake, and called the gods
to hear his vows, the Rutuli vie in exhorting one
another to arms. One is moved by the peerless
beauty of his form and youth, one by his royal an-
cestry, another by the glorious deeds of his hand.
