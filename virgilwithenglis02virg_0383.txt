THE MINOR POEMS

Keppler, Ueber δορα (Leipzig, 1908); Plesent‚ Le
Culex (Paris, 1910); Skutsch, Ans Vergils Fruhzez't
(Leipzig, 1901-6); Birt, Jugendverse und Heimat-
poesie Vergils (Leipzig, 1910); Phillimore, “The
Text of the Culex,'' in Classical Philology‚ vol. ν.
(1910). Professor Phillimore is one of three English
scholars who have recently upheld the genuineness
of the Culex as an early work of Virgil's, the other
two being S. Elizabeth Jackson (Classical Quarterly,
1911, pp. 163 ff.) and W. &Varde Fowler (Classical
Εευίεη», 1914, pp. 119 ff.). The authenticity of others
of these poems as well seems to be assumed by
Mooney in his metrical translation of The sslinor
Poems of Vergil (Birmingham, 1916). This book,
however, does not include the Ciris. Birt is a stout
advocate of the Virgilian authorsbip of most of the
poems of the Catalepton. See also vol. i., p. vii.
