AENEID BOOK A

men stand round3 he himself, sick and panting,
eased his neck, while over his chest streams his flow-
ing heard. Many a time he asks for Lausim, and
many a time he sends messengers to recall him, and
convey the charge of his grieving sire. But Lausus
his weeping comrades were bearing liseless on liis
armour-——a mighty one and laid low by a mighty
wound. The ill-boding heart knew their wail afar.
His hoary hair he defiles with a shower of dust,
spreads both hands to heaven, :ind clasps his arms
about the corpse: “My son! and did such joy of life
possess me, that in my stead Ι suffered thee to meet
the foeman's sword——thee, whom I begat? Ain Ι,
thy father, saved by these wounds of thine, and
living by thy death? Ah me! now at last is come
to ine, alas! the bitterness of death; now is my

· wound driven deep! Yea, and I, my son, stained

thy name with guilt—I, driven in loathing from the
throne and sceptre of my fathers. Long have Ι
owed my punishment to my country and my people's
liate; by any form of death should Ι myself have
yielded up my guilty life. Now I live on, and leave
not yet daylight and mankind ; but leave I will.'’ And
with the word he raises himself on his stricken thigh,
and though liis force flags by reason of the deep wound,
yet, undismayed, he bids his horse he brought. This
was his pride, this his solace3 011 this he passed vic-
torious from every battle. He addresses the grieving
beast and accosts it thus: “Rhoebus, long have we
lived, if to mortal beings aught be long. To-day
thou slialt either bear off in victory yonder bloody
spoils with the head of Aeneas, and avenge with me
the sufferings of Lausus, or, if no force opens a way,
thou shalt die with me3 for thou, gallant steed, wilt
not deign, methinks, to brook a stranger's bidding
