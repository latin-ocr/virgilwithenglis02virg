Ο BA'rTAnus‚² let us repeat the notes of the swan:
again let us sing our divided homes and lands—-those
lands whereon we have pronounced our curses, unholy
prayers. Sooner shall kids prey upon wolves, sooner
calves upon lions; sooner shall dolpliins flee before

³ Lyeurgus is one of the soldiers who have taken possession
of the poet’s land. qs. the plur. in u. 9 and 10.
