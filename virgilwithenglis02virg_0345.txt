AENEID BOOK XII

shudder ran through their inmost marrow: first
before all the Latins Juturna heard and knew the
sound, and in terror fled away. Aeneas wings his
way, and sweeps his dark column over the open
plain. As when a tempest bursts, and a storm-cloud
moves towards land through mid-ocean, the hearts
of hapless husbandmen, alas! know it from far and
shudder—downfall will it bring to trees and havoc
to crops, it will o’erthrow all far and wide—before it
fly the winds, and wast their voices shoreward : even
so the Rhoeteianl chief full against the foe brings
up his band3 densely they gather, each and all, to
his side in close-packed columns. Thymbraeus
smites mighty Osiris with the sword, Mnestheus
slays Arcetius, Achates Epulo, Gyas Ufens3 falls
too even the augur Tolumnius, who first had hurled
his spear full against the foe. A shout rises to
heaven, and in turn the routed Rutulians mid clouds
of dust turn their backs in ssight across the fields.

or wield their darts : Turnus alone he, with searching
glauce, tracks out through the thick gloom, alone
summotis to battle.

rioteer, from amid his reins, and leaves him afar,
fallen from the pole; herself takes his place, and
guides with her hands the flowing thongs, assuming
all that Metiscus had ,—his voice, form, arms. As
when a black swallow flits thloug h a rich lord's
ample mansion and wings her way through stately
halls, gleaning for her chilping nestlings tiny crumbs
