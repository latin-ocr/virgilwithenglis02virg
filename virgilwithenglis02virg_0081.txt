AENEID BOOK VIII

between the shady woods and plying noiseless oars,
they are affrighted by the sudden sight, and all rise
up, quitting the feast. But Pallas, undaunted, for-
bids them to break off the rites, and seizing his
spear, flies himself to meet the strangers, and from
a mound afar eries: “Warriors, what cause has
driven you to try unknown paths? Whither fare
ye? Of what race are ye? From what home ? Is
it peace or war ye bring hither?'' Then father
Aeneas speaks thus from the high stern, outstretch-
ing in his hand a branch of peaceful olive: “ Men
born of Troy thou seest, and arms hostile to
Latins-—men whom they have driven to flight by
insolent warfare. We seek Evander: bear ye this
message, and say that chosen captains of Dardania
are come, suing for alliance in arms.'’ Smitten with
amaze was Pallas at that mighty name. “Come
forth,’' he eries, “whoe’er thou art; speak to my
father face to face, and pass, a guest, beneath our
roof!’' And with a grasp of welcome he caught
and clung to his hand. Advancing, they enter the
grove and leave the river.

king: “Noblest of the sons of Greece, to whom
Fortune has willed that Ι make my prayer, and
offer boughs decked with fillets, I feared not because
thou wert a Danaan chief, an Arcadian and linked
by blood with the twin sons of Atreus ;))ut my own
worth and Heaven's holy orac-les, our ancestral kin-
ship, and thy fame spread through the world, have
bound me to thee, and brought me Fate's willing
follower. Dardanus, first father and founder 01
