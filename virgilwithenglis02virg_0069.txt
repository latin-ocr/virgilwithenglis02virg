AENEID BOOK VII

marshy shores, where stands Diana’s altar, rich and
gracious. For they tell how that Hippolytus, when
he fell by his stepdame's craft, and slaked a sire's
vengeance in blood, torn asunder by frightened
steeds—came again to the starry firmament and
heaven’s upper air, recalled by the Healer’s herbs
and Diana’s love. Then the Father omnipotent,
wroth that any mortal should rise from the nether
shades to the light of life, himself with his thunder
hurled down to the Stygian waters the finder of
such healing-craft, the Phoebus-born.¹ But Trivia,
kindly goddess, hides Hippolytus in a secret dwell-
ing, and sends him away to the nymph Egeria and
her grove, that there alone, amid Italian woods, he
might live out his inglorious days, and take the
altered name of Virbius. Hence, too, hoofed horses
are kept far from Trivia’s temple and hallowed
groves, for that they, affrighted by ocean-monsters,
strewed chal-iot and youth along the shore. None
the less, his son was driving his fiery steeds on the
level plain, and speeding charioted to war.

of wondrous frame, holding sword in hand, and by
a whole head o'ertopping all. His lofty helmet,
crested with triple plume, upbears a Chimaera,
breathing from her jaws Aetnean fires, lo! raging
the more, and the madder with baleful flames, the
more blood is outpoured and the fiercer waxes the
fight. But, on his polished shield, Io with uplifted
horns was emblazoned in gold,2—10, wondrous device,
already o'ergrown with bristles, already a heifer,--
and Argus the maiden’s warder, and father Inachus

¹ Aesculapius, son of Apollo (the Healer).

¹ A figure of 10, wrought in gold, formed the device on the
iron shield. ⁶⁷
