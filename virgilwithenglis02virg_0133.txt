AENEID BOOK IX

Dawn a vast cloud was seen to speed athwart the
sky, with Ida's choirs in its train ;1 thereon through
the air fell an awful voice, filling the Trojan and
Rutulian ranks: “Trouble not, ye Teucrians, to
defend my ships, nor take weapons into your hands.
Turnus shall have leave to burn up the seas sooner
than my sacred pines. Go ye free3 go, goddesses
of ocean; the Mother bids it.'’ And at once each
ship rends her cable from the bank, and like dolphins
they dip their beaks and dive to the water’s depths ;
then as maiden forms—O wondrous portentl—they
emerge in like number and bear out to sea.

Thus the seas are pathless for the Teum-jans, and
hope of ssight there is none. One half the world is
lost to them, but the earth is in our hands : in such
thousands are the nations of Italy under arms.
Naught do I dread all the fateful oracles of heaven
whereof these Phrygians boast: to Fate and Venus
all claims are paid, in that the Trojans have touched
'our rich Ausonia’s fields. I too have my fate to meet
theirs—-to cut down with the sword a guilty race that
