AENEID BOOK XII

as an arrOW, shot from string through a cloud,
which, armed with gall of fell poison, a Parthian—-
a Parthian or a Cydonian—has launched, a shaft be-
yond all cure; whizzing‚ it leaps through the swift
shadows, known of none: so sped the child of
Night, and sought the earth. Soon as she sees the
Ilian ranks and Turnus‘ troops, suddenly shrinking
to the shape of that small bird which oft, perched
at night on tombs or deserted roofs, chants her late,
ill-omened lay amid the shadows, so changed in form
before the face of Turnus the flend flits screaming
to and fro, and wildly beats his buckler with her
wings. A strange numbness unknits his limbs with
dread3 his hair stood up in terror and the voice
clave to his throat.

8⁶⁹ But when from afar J uturna knew the Dread
One’s whizzing wings‚ she rends, hapless one, her
loosened tresses, marring, in sisterly grief, her face
with nails and her breast with clenched hands:
“ What now, my Turnus, can thy sister avail thee?
Or what more awaits me, that have endured so much ?
With what art may Ι prolong thy day? Can l face
such a portent? Now, now I quit the field. Affright
not my fluttering soul‚ ye ill-boding birds ! Ι know
your beating wings, and their dreadful sound, nor fail
Ι to mark the haughty mandates of high-hearted
Jove. Is this his requital for my maidenhood?
Wherefore gave he me life eternal? Why of the
law of death am Ι bereaved? Now surely could Ι
end such anguish, and pass at my poor brother's
side amid the shadows! 1 immortali Nay, will
aught of mine be sweet to me without thee, my
brother? Ο what deepest earth can gape enough
