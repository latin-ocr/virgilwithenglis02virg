upon the vines, let the crops become their food,
let the blaze in scattered fires wing its way athwart
the breezes, and link the corn-ears with the trees!
Where the unholy rod measured our fields, where
once were our boundaries, let all become ashes !''

4⁷ Thus I pray, and in our prayers may these
strains abound!

“O waveS, that with your waters beat the shores3
0 shores, that o’er the fields scatter sweet breezes,
give ear to these eries. Let Neptune with his waves
pass to the tilth, and with thick sand cover the fields!
Where Vulcan, feeding on the lands, has burned with
heaven’s fires, be it called a sister of the Libyan sand,
a second Syrtis! ”

⁶³ This sadder strain, O Battarus, I remember thou
didst recall t

“ Many fearsome things, they say, swim in the
blaek sea—monsters that oft-times terrify with forins
unlooked for, when suddenly they have reared their
bodies from out the raging deep. These hidden
things may Neptune chase with threatening trident,
on all sides upturning with the winds the murky sea-
surge, and in his hoary waves swallowing the swarthy
ashes ll Let my lands be called the savage sea; be-
ware, O sailor, of lands, whereon we have pronounced
our curses, unholy prayers l ¹'

⁶⁸ If this, O Neptune, we do not pour into thy
cars, do thou, O Battarus, consign our sorrows to the
streams; for to thee the springs, to thee the streams
are ever friendly. No further ruin can I effect2; to
Dis all belongs of right.

“Turn back your running waters, ye roving
streams3 turn back, and pour thern again over the
