AENEID BOOK VIII

called Pallanteum. These wage war ceaselessly with
the Latin race3 these do thou take to thy camp as
allies, and join with them in league. I myself will
guide thee along the banks straight up the stream,
that so, impelled by thy oars, thou mayest o'ercome
the opposing current. Up, arise, goddess-born, and, as
the stars first set, duly offer prayers to J uno, and with
suppliant vows vanquish her wrath and her threats.
To me thou shalt pay thy tribute when victorious.
Ι am he whom thou seest laving my banks with full
flood and cleaving the rich tilth,*the blue Tiber,
river best beloved of Heaven. Here is my stately
home3 from lofty cities flows my sonutam-head.l ''

⁶⁰ So spake the River, then plunged into his deep
pool, seeking the lowest parts ; night and sleep left
Aeneas. He arises, and gazing on the eastern beams
of the celestial sun, in due form uplifts water from
the stream in his hollow palms, and pours forth to
Heaven this prayer: “ Ye Nymphs, Laurentine
Nymphs, from whom rivers have their being, and
thou, O father Tiber, thou and thy hallowed stream——
receive Aeneas, and at last shield him from perils.
In whatsoever springs thy pools contain thee, who
pitiest our travails, from whatsoever soil thou flowest
forth in all thy beauty, ever with my offerings, ever
with my gists, shalt thou be graced, thou horned
stream, lord of Hesperian waters. Only be thou
with me, and more surely confirm thy will ! ’¹ So he
speaks, and choosing two galleys from his fleet mans
them with crews, and withal equips his comi-ades
with arms.

¹ The Tiber rises in Etruria. This verse, of doubtful
meaning, is rendered thus by some: “Here rises my great,
home, ,the head of mighty eities‚'’ the “ home'’ being either
the river-god’s palace under the water, or the city of Rome.
