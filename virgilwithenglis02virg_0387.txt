¹¹ The glou of Latona and mighty Jove, their
golden offspri ng, even Phoebus, shall be the fount
and source of our song, and he with resounding
harp shall mspu e, whether Arna nurture him— Aina,
steeped' 111 the Chimaera s stream of Xanthus—or the
glory of Asteria,¹ or that land where Parnassus'
ridge, with broad brOW, spreads his horns this way
and that, and Castalia’s singing waves glide in their
watery course.2 Wherefore, come, ye sister Ν313115,3
glory of the Pierian spring, and throng about the
god in sportive dance. Thou too, holy Pales, to
whom, as they appear, the blessings of husbandmen
return with increase, be thine the care of him who
keeps the lofty forest-homes and woodlands green;
whilst thou dost tend them, freely 1 roam among the
glades and caves.

24 Thou also, O Octavius revered‚4 who by the
writings thou hast earned winnest confidence, gra-
ciously attend my venture, O holy youth! For thee,
indeed, my page sings not Jove’ s gloomy w,5ar 1101
plants the lines whereuith Phleg rra once 1›1istled,t11e
land that was spiinkled with tlie Giants' blood, nor
drives the Lapiths upon the Centaurs’ sw·01ds; the
East burns not the Erichthonian towersss with flames :
'tis not the piercing of Athos, not the casting of
fetters upon the mighty deep, not the Hellespont,v
smitten with horses' hooves, what time Greece feared
the Persians, as they streamed from every side, that
at this late hour shall, through my book, seek fame :
