from amhush summons his lance, and thus prays
aloud to Heaven:

735 “Apollo‚ most high of gods, guardian of holy
Soracte, whose chief worshippers are we, for whom
is fed the blaze of the pine-wood heap, while we thy
votaries, passing in strength of saith amid the fire,
plant our steps on the deep embers 1—grant that this
shame be effaced by our arms, O Father Almighty!

nor any spoils; other feats shall bring me fame; so
but this dread scourge fall stricken beneath my blow,
inglorious Ι will return to the cities of my sires.''

⁷94 Phoebus heard, and in his heart vouchsafed
that half his prayer should prosper; half he scattered
to the flying breezes. To o’erthrow and strike down
Camilla in sudden death, he yielded to his prayer;

queen. She herself, neither of air, nor of sound, nor
of weapon coming from the sky recked aught, till the
spear, borne home, beneath the bare breast found
lodging, and, driven deep, drank her maiden blood.
In alarm, her comrades hurry around her, and catch
their falling queen. Startled above all, Arruns flees
in mingled joy and fear, and no more dares he to
trust his lance, or to meet the maiden’s weapons.
And lo! even as the wolf, when he has slain a shep-
herd or a great steer, ere hostile darts can pursue

¹ ln the ancient rites on Mount Soracte, the worshippers
walked three times through a pine-fire, carrying offerings to
the god. Os. Pliny, Nat. Hisc. vn. 2, 19.
