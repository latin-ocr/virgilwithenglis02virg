truly through thee, and thee alone, has Love ever
brought grief, either to my child in other days, or
now to my distraught fosterling! Have I, who was
taken captive and carried off to this distant land,l
who have suffered such grievous servitude and harsh
travails, have Ι failed to escape thee, O thou who art
already for the second time the cruel destruction of
my loved ones? Now, now, even for me, who am
older than is meet, there lives no child, so that I
may long to live. Why have I, frenzied one, when
thou, Britomartis, thou, Britomartis, the sole hope of
my tomb, wert torn from nie—why have 1 been able
to prolong my day of life? And would that thou,
maiden so dear to fleet Diana, hadst neither pursued,
a maiden‚ the hunt that belongs to men, nor, aiming
Gnosian shafts from Parthian bow, hadst driven the
Dictaean goats to their familiar meadows! Never
with such resolve to flee from Minos' passion wouldst
thou have sped headlong from the towering moun-
tam-cmg? whence some relate that thou didst ssee,
and assign thee the godhead of the virgin Aphaea3
but others, that so thy fame might be greater,3 have
called the moon Dictyna aster thy name. May this,
Ι pray, be true; for me at least, my child, thou art
no more. Never shall 1 see thee flitting on the
mountain's highest peak amid the Hyrcanian hounds,
thy comrades, and the wild beast throng, nor on thy
return shall Ι hold thee in my embrace.

¹ i.e. from Crete to Megara.

² (ff. Ecloyues, vm. 59.

³ The poet iinplies that the name Dictyna, by which
Diana, the Moon-goddess, was also known (cf. Tibullus, 1.
iv. 253 Ovid, rlIetamorphoses, 11. 441, etc.)‚ had been given to
Britomartis herself. Pausanias (11. xxx. 3) tells us that
Britomartis was known as Dietyna in Crete, and as Aphaea
in Aegina.
