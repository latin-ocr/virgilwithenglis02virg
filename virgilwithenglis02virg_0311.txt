AENEID BOOK XI

ing the field in triumphant warfare‚ the panic now
passing to the town. He, raging—and Jove's stem
will so demands—quits ’che hills' ambush, and leaves
the rough woodland. Scarce had he passed from
view and gained the plain, when father Aeneas,
entering the unguarded pass, scales the ridge‚ and
issues from the shady wood. So both march toward
the walls, swiftly and in full force, nor far distant
from each other: and at 'che same moment Aeneas
descried afar the plain smoking with dust, and saw
the Laurentiue hosts, and Turnus was aware of fell
Aeneas in arms, and heard the coming of feet and
the snorting of steeds. And straigh'cway would
they enter the fray and essay conflict, but ruddy
Phoebus now laves his weary team in the Iberian
flood, and, as day ebbs, brings back the night. Be-
fore the city they encamp and strengthen the
ramparts.
