Rutulian, no distinction shall I make, whether it be
Italy’s fate that holds the camp in leaguer, or Troy's
baneful error and misleading prophecies. Nor do I
free the Rutulians.1 Each one's own course shall
bring him weal or woe. Jupiter is king over all alike ;
the fates 311311 find their way.'' By the waters of his
Stygian brother, by the banks that seethe with pitch
and black swirling waters, he nodded assent, and
with the nod made all Olympus tremble. So passed
the pai-ley. Then from his golden throne rose Jupiter,
and the celestial company gather round and escort
him to the threshold.

118 Meanwhile, about every gate tlic Rutulians
press 011, to slaughter the foe with the sword, and
to gird the ramparts with flame. But the host of the
Aeneadae is held pent within the palisades, and
hope of escape is none. Forlorn and hclpless they
stand on the high towcrs, and girdle the walls with
scanty ring. Asius, 3011 of Imbrasus, and ThymoetcS,
son of Hicetaon, and the two Assaraci, and Castor,
and old Thymbris are the soremost rank3 at their
side are Sarpedon’s two brothers, Clarus and Thae-
mon, come from lofty Lycia. One, strainiug his
whole frame, uplifts a giant rock, no scant frag-
ment of a mount, even Acmon of Lyrnesus, huge as
his father Clytius, or his brother Mnestheus. Some
‚with darts and some with stones, they strivc to ward
off the foe, and hurl fire and fit arrows to the string.
In their 1nidst,lo! the Dardan boy himself, Venus'
most rightful care, his comely head uncovered, glit-
ters like a jewel inset in yellow gold to adorn or
neck or head, or as ivory gleams, skilfully inlaid in
boxwood or Orician terebinth3 his milk-white neck

¹ ale. from obligations. Jupiter's deeree is to bind them as
well as the Trojans.
