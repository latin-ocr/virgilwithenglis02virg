AENEID BOOK VIII

his palace‚ cut down his followers, and hurl fire on
his roof. He, amid the carnage, flees for refuge to
Rutulian soil, and finds shelter among the weapons
of Turnus his friend. So all Etruria has risen in
righteous fury3 with instant war they demand the
king for punishment. Of these thousands, Aeneas, Ι
will make thee chief3 for their ships throng all the
shore clamouring, and they bid the standards advance,
but the aged soothsayer restrains them with prophecy
of fate: ‘O chosen warriors of Maeonia, flower and
chivalry of an olden race‚—ye, whom just resentment
launches against the foe, and Mezentius inflames
with righteous wrath, no man of ltaly may sway a
race so proud : choose ye sti-anger leaders l ’ At that
the Etruscan lines settled down on yonder plain,
awed by Heaven’s warning; Tarchon himself has
sent me envoys with the royal crown and sceptre,
and offers the ensigns of power, bidding me join the
camp and mount the Tyrrhene throne. But the srost
of sluggish eld, outworn with years, and strength too
sere for deeds of valour, begrudge me the command.
My son would I urge thereto, were it not that, of
mingled blood by Sabine mother, he drew from her a
share in his fatherland. Thou, to whose years and
race Fate is kind, whom Heaven calls, take up thy
task, most valiant leader of Trojans and Italians both.
Nay more, I will join with thee Pallas here, our hope
and comfort; under thy guidance let him learn to
endure warfare and the stern work of battle ; let him
behold thy deeds, and revere thee from his early years.
To him will I give two hundred Arcadian horse,
choice flower of our manhood, and in his own name
Pallas will give thee as many more.”
