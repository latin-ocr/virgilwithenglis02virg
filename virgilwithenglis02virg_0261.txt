AENEID BOOK XI

and glowing wheels; others, offerings familiar to
the dead-their own shields and luckless weapons.
Around, many a stout ox is sacrificed to Death;
bristly swine and cattle hai-ried from all the country
are slaughtered over the flames. Then, over all the
shore, they watch their comrades burning, and keep
guard above the charred pyres, nor can tear them-
selves away till dewy night rolls round the heaven,
inset with gleaming stam}
2⁰3 Nor less, elsewhere, the hapless Latins built
pyres innumerable. Of their many slain, some they
bury in the earth, some they raise and carry to the
neighbouring fields or send home to the city; the
rest, a mighty mass of indistinguishable slaughter‚
they burn unreckoned and unhonoured: then on
all sides, emulous with close-clustering fires, flare
the broad fields. The third morn had withdrawn
chill shade from heaven; mournfully they stirred
from the pyres the bones mingled with deep ashes,
and heapcd above them a warm mound of earth.
But within the walls, in the city of rich Latinus, is
the chief uproar and the long wail’s largest portion.
Here mothers and their sons’ unhappy brides, here
the loving hearts of sori-owing sisters, and boys bereft
of sires, call curses on the fell war and on Turnus’
nuptials ε “ He, he himself‚’' they cry, “ should decide
the issue by arms and the sword, he who claims for
himself the realm of Italy and foremost honours.’'
Fierce Drances weights the scale, and bears witness
that Turnus alone is called, alone is summoned to
battle. Over against them, the while, many an opinion
in varied phrase speaks for Turnus, the shadow os
the queen's great name is his shelter, and many a
tale with well-won trophies upholds the hero.
