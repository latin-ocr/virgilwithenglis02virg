AENEID BOOK X

⁶⁷⁵ Meanwhile, with their two white steeds, there
dash into the midst Lucagus and Liger his brother;
but the brother guides the steeds with the reins,
while Lucagus fiercely whirls his drawn sword. Their
furious onset Aeneas could not brook, but rushed
upon them, and towered gigantie with opposing
spear. To him Liger: “Not Diomede’s horses dost
thou see, nor Achilles’ car, nor Phrygia’s plains;
this honr shall upon this soil end thy warfare and
thy life.’' Such words fly abroad from mad Liger's
lips. But not in words the Trojan hero shapes reply,
for he hurls his javelin against the foe. Then, as
Lucagus, bending forward to the stroke, urged 011
1115 steeds with the sword, even when, with left foot
advanced, he gets ready for the fray, there comes
the spear through the lowest rim of his gleaming
shield, then pierces the left groin; tumbling from
the car, he rolls in death upon the plain, while good
Aeneas bespeaks him with bitter words: “ Lucagus,
no coward flight of thy steeds has betrayed thy car3
no vain shadow of a foe has turned them back3 thy-
self, leaping from the wheels, forsakest thy beasts.’'
So saying, he seized the steed33 down-gliding from the
sels—same car, the brother piteously outstretched his
helpless hands: “ By thyself, by the parents who
gave life to such a 5011, O hero of Troy, spare this life,
and have pity on my prayer!'' Longer had been
his plea, but Aeneas: “ Not such erewhile were thy
words. Die, and let not brother forsake b1·other!''
-then with the sword he eleft open the bosom,
wherein 15 life's lurking-place. Such were the deaths
the Dardan chieftain wrought o'er the plains, raging
like torrent-brool< or black tempest. At last the boy
Ascanius and the vainly beleaguered warriors burst
forth aud leave the camp.
