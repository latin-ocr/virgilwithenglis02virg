AENEID BOOK VII

the midst of slumbers. Allecto puts oil* her grim
features and fiendish limbs, transforms herself to an
old dame’s face, furrows her loathly brow with
wrinkles, assumes hoary locks and fillet, next en-
twines them with an olive spray, and becomes Calybe,
aged priestess of Juno's temple, then, with these
words, presents herself to the young man’s eyes:

“Turnus, wilt thou brook all these toils poured 101 th
in vain, and thy sceptre transferred to Dardan
settlers? The king denies thee thy bride and the
dower thy blood has won, and a strangei is sought
as heir to thy throne. Go now, confront thankless
perils, thou scorned one: go, lay low the Tuscan
ranks; shield the Latins with peace. This it was
that, in very presence, Saturn's almighty daughter
bade me say to thee, as thou wert lying in the
stillness of night. Rise then, and gladly make
ready the arming of thy youth, and their march from
the gates to battle. Consume the Phrygiam ehiefs,
who are anehored in our fair stream, and burn their
painted ships. The mighty power of the gods com-
mands. Let King Latinus himself, unless he consent
to give thee thy bride, and stand by his word, know
of it, and at last make proof of Turnus as a foe.'’

435 Hereon, the youth, moeking at the seer, thus in
turn takes up the speech : ‘⁵ That a {leet has entered
Tiber's waters, the tale has not, as thou deemest,
escaped my ear-—feign not for me such terrors-—nor
is Queen Juno unmindful of me. But thee, O
mother, old age, enfeebled by decay and barren of
truth, frets with vain distress, and amid the feuds of
kings mocks thy prophetie soul with false alarms.
Thy charge it is to keep the gods’ images and tem-
ples3 war and peace they shall wield, whose work
war is. '
