AENEID BOOK X

Aeneas from the Tuscan shores, arming the ships
and riding o'er the sea.

1⁶⁶ At their head Massicus cleaves the waters in
the bronze-plated Tiger: under him is a band of a
thousand youths, who have left the walls of Clusium
and the city of Cosae; their weapons arrows, light
quivers on the shoulders, and deadly bows. With
him is grim Abas, all his train in dazzling armour,
his vessel glcaming with a gilded Apollo. To him
Populonia had given six hundred of licr sons, all
skilled in war, but llva three hundred—an island
rich in the Chalybes’ inexhaustible mines.² Third
comes Asilas, famous interpreter between gods and
men, whom the victinis’ entrails obey, and the stars
of heaven, the tongues of birds and prophetie light-
ning sires. A thousand men he hurries to war in
serried array and bristling with spears. These Pisa
bids obey him—city of Alphean birth, but set in
Tuscan soil. Then follows Astyr, of wondrous beauty
——Astyr, relying on his steed and many-coloured
arms. Three hundred more—all of one soul in fol-
lowing—come from the men who have their home in
Caere and in the plains of Minio, in ancient Pyrgi,
and sever-strichen Graviscae.

185 Nor would Ι pass thee by, O Cinyras, bravest
in war of Ligurian captains, or thee, Cupavo, with
thy scanty train, from whose erest rise the swan-
plumes—-a reproach, Ο Love, to thee and thine 2—
even the badge of his father's form. For they tell
that Cycnus, in grief for his loved Phaethon, while he
is singing and with music solacing his woeful love
amid the shade of his sisters’ leafy poplars, drew

youth' s destruction by Jupiter. Being plunged into grief
he was transformed into a swan. The sistere of Phaethon
were at the sanie time changed into poplars.
