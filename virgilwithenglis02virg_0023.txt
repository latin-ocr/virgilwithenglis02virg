AENEID BOOK VII

lay their limbs to rest under the boughs of a high
tree, and spread the feast3 they place cakes of meal
along the sward beneath the viands—Jove himself
inspired them-and they crown the wheaten base
with fruits of the field. Here, haply, when the rest
was consumed, and the scantness of fare drove them
to turn their teeth upon the slender ‹takes-to
profane with hand and dal-ing jaw the fateful circles
of crust, and spare not the broad loavesl: “Hal
we eat our tables too!’' quoth Iiilus, jesting3 this
and no more. That cry,2 when heard, first brought
an end of toil; and as it first fell from the speaker's
lips, his father caught it up and held it fast,3 awe-
struek at Heaven's will. Straightway, “Hail, O
land,” he eries, “destined as my due! and hail to
you, ye faithful gods of Troy! Here is our home,
here our country ! For my father Anchises—now Ι
recall it—bequeathed me this secret of fatet ‘ My
son, when, wafted to an unknown shore, hunger shall
compel thee, as food fails, to devour thy tables, then
in thy wear-iness hope for a home, and there be
mindful first to set up thy dwellings with thy hand
and bank them with a mound.' This was that hun-
ger foretold‚ this the last strait awaiting us, that
should set an end to our deadly woes! Come then,
and, gladly with the sun's first beams, let us explore
what lands these are, what people here dwell, where
is the city of the nation, and let us fare forth from
the harbour in divers ways. Now pour your cups to
Jove, and call in prayer on my sire Anchises, and
set the wine again upon the boa1·d.”

Celaeno, not by Anchises.
