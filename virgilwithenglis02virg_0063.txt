AENEID BOOK v11

was born to Vulcan among the rural herds, and
found upon the hearth. Him, in loose array, a rustic
legion attends: they who dweil in steep Praeneste,
and the fields of Gabine June, by the cold Anio
and the Herniean rocks with their dewy streams;
they whom rich Anagnia nurtures, and thou, father
Amasenus. Not all of these have armour, οι· shields,
or sounding chariots. The most part shower bullets
of livid lead ; part wield in the hand two darts, and
have for head-gear tawny caps of wolf-skin. Bare is
the left foot as they plant their steps ; a boot of raw-
hide shields the other.

69¹ But Messapus, tamer of horses, the seed of
Neptune, whom none may lay low with {ire or steel,
suddenly calls to arms tribes long inert and hands
unused to war, and again grasps the sword. These
hold the ranks of Fescennium and of Aequi Falisci;
these Soracte's heights and Flavinian fields, Ciminus’
lake and hill and the groves of Capena. In measurcd
time they marched and sang their king: as ofttimes
snowy swans amid the moist clouds, when they
return from feeding, and from their long throats
utter their tuneful strains; afar the river echoes,
and the smitten Asiam mead.l Nor would one think
that mail-clad ranks were massed in that vast array,
but that high in air, a cloud of hoarse-voiced birds
was pressing shoreward from the deep guif.

ing a mighty host, and equal to a mighty host himself}

¹ Referring to the valley of the Cayster in Lydia.

² (gf. Livy, Π. 16, where we learn that the Claudian tribe
was founded by Attus Clausus, who seceded from the Sabines
in 506 B.c. and was received as a citizen in Rome. virgil,
however, refers the founding of the Claudiam qens to the

earlier day when Romulus formed a treaty with the Sabines
under T. Tatius.
