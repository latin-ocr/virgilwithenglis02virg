he gave laws to the assembled nations—the sceptro,
the sacred diadem, and the robes wrought by Ilium's

face fixed in steady gaze downward, rolling the while
his earnest eyes. Nor is it so much that the em-
broidered purple or the sceptre of Priam moves the
king, as that he broods o’er his daughter’s wedlock
and bridal bed, and revolves in his breasb the oracle
