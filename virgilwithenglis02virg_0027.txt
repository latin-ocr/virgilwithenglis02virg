AENEID BOOK VII

with their arms tough darts, and challenge to race
or boxing bont—when, galloping up, a messenger
brings word to the aged monarch’s ears that mighty
men are come in unknown attire. The king bids
them be summoned within the halls, and takes his
seat in the midst on his ancestral throne.

¹⁷⁰ Stately and vast, towering with a hundred
columns, his house crowned the city, once the palace
of Laurentian Picus, awe-inspiring with its grove and
the sanctity of olden days. Here 'twas auspicious
for kings to receive the sceptre, and first uplift the
fasees; this shrine was their senate-house, this the
scene of their holy feasts; here, after slaughter of
rams, the elders were wont to sit down at the long
line of tables. Yea, and in order are images of their
forefathers of yore, carved of old cedar—Italus and
father Sabinus, planter of the vine, guarding in his
image the curved pruning-hook, and aged Saturn,
and the likeness of two-faced „Ianus—all standing in
the vestibule3 and other kings from the beginning,
and they who had suffered wounds of war, fighting
for their fatherland. Many arms, moreover, hang
on the sacred doors, captive chariots, curved axes,
helmet-crests and massive bars of gat-es ; javelins and
shields and beaks wrenched from ships. There sat
one, holding the Quirinal staffl and girt with short
robe, his left hand bearing the sacred shield—even
Picus, tamer of steeds, whom his bride Circe, smitten
with love’s longing, struck with her golden rod, and
with drugs changed into a bird with plumes of
dappled hue.

¹ Quirinus (ssse. Romulus) was Rome’s first augur, and as
such carried the augnr’s badges of office—the lituus, or eurved
staff, and the ancile, or sacred shield—while he wore the
purple striped toga, or trabea.
