LYDIA

201 envy you, ye fields; my joys ye possess, and
now ye have her, who aforetime was my delight.
But my dying limbs are wasting with grief, and
warmth fails me, steeped in the chill of death,
because my mistress is not with me. No girl on
earth was more skilled or more lovely3 and, if the
tale be not false, then worthy of Jupiter as bull or
as gold1 (turn thine ear aside, Ο Jupiter l), is my

irl alone.

g 2⁸ O happy bull, sire and pride of the mighty herd,
never does the heifer, secking stalls apart, suffer thee
to low thy grief vainly to the woods. And thou,
sire of the kids, happy and ever blest, whether thou,
roaming o’er the rocks, seekest the steepy mountains
or whether, in woods or on plains, it please thee to
scorn fresh forage: with thee is thy happy mate.
And wherever is a male, with him is ever joined his
mate, and never has he bewailed an interrupted love.
Why, O Nature, hast thou not with us too been kind?
Why so oft do I suffer cruel grief?

³⁹ When through the green heavens the pale stars
come back, and in turn the golden orb of Phoebus
departs on his course, thy love,2 O Moon, is with
thee: why is not mine also with me? O Moon, thou
knowest what grief is: pity one who grieves. For he
who bears thee‚3 O Phoebus, celebrates love for the
laurel; and what procession has told the story of a
god, when fame has not told it in the woods? A god
(ye gods are everywhere) carries his joys ⁴¹ with him,

³ Le. thy image in procession. Daphne, fleeing from the
attention of Phoebus Apollo, was changed into a laurel.
⁴ αρ- Apollo carries with him the laurel, and Pan his
piperi.
