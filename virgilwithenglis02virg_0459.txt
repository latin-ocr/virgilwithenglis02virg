CIRIS

⁴9⁰ Hereon, as when at first in a snowy egg there
is the soft outline of a living thing, and the limbs’
imperfect junctures, as they grow together in un-
wonted heat, float about, yet incomplete3 so with
Scylla’s body, encompassed by the waters of the
deep, while the parts were even yet uncertain, the
half-human joints were changing it throughout, and
throughout were being changed. First, the lovely
face and those lips yearned for by many, and the
broad brow’s eharm, began to grow together and to
prolong the chin with a slender beak. Then, where
on the head the line appeared that parts the hair in
cqual portions, lo! of a sudden, as if copying her sire’s
glory, on her crown a tuft waved its crimson erest,
while soft plumes, blending varied hues, clothed her
marble-white body with vesture of wings, and the
fceble arms put forth long feathers. Then other
parts and the legs, coloured with blushing crimson,
an unfamiliar leanness overlaid with rough skin, and
to the tender feet fastened sharp nails. And yet
to succour the hapless maiden in this manner only
was scm-ce worthy of Neptune's gentle spouse.
Never hereafter did the eyes of her kin behold her
tying back her purple fillets upon her golden head;
no chamber, fragrant with Syrian spice, no home
weleomed her3 what, indeed, had she to do with
home? And soon as from the hoary tide with speed
and uproar she arose to the sky on whirring wings,
and far and wide has scattered a cloud of spi-ay o'er
the waters, the hapless maid, vainly recovered from
death, lives her wild life among the lonely rocks—-

the rocks and cliffs and deserted shores. 445
