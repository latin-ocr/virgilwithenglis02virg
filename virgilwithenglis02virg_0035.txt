their high stalls. At once for all the TeucrIans in
order he commands them to be led forth, fleet oi
foot and caparisoned with purple and embroidered
housings. Golden are the chains that hang drooping
from their breasts, of gold are their trappings, and
yellow gold they champ with their teeth. For the
absent Aeneas he chooses a car and twin coursers of
ethei-eal seed, breathing fire from their nostrils, and
sprung from the stock of those steeds which cunning
Circe, stealing them from her sire, bred bastard from
the mare she had mated.l With such words and

their horses, return carrying back peace.

from Argos, city of Inachus, holding her airy flight;
and from the sky afar, even from Sicilian Pachynus,
she espied the rejoicing Aeneas and his Dardau fleet.
She sees them already building a home, already trust-
ing in the land, their ships deser-ted. She stopped,

them? Lo ! through the midst of armies, through the
midst of flames, they have found a way. But, me-
thinks, my power at last lies outworn3 οι· my wrath
is sated, and I rest! Nay more, when they were
hurled forth from their country, with my vengeance
I dared to follow the exiles through the waves
and confi-ont them o'er all the deep: against the
Teucrians has been spent all the power of sea and sky.
Yet what have the Syrtes availed me, or Scylla,

moi-tal, while her mare was of mortal stock.
