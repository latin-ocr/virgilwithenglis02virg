CULEX

wa have trifled, O Octavius,1 while a slender Muse
marked the measure, and lo! like tiny spiders‚ have
fashioned our thin-spun task. We have trifled: to
this end let our Gnat’s song be sung, that in sportive
mood throughout its course our argument may har-
monize with epic story. A truce to thee, O Art ; let
Envy begonel thoso is ready to blame our jests
and Muse, shall be deemed lighter than even our
Gnat in weight and name. Hereafter shall our Muse
speak to thee in deeper tones, when the seasons
yield me their fruits in peace, that so thou mayest
find her verses polished, and worthy of thy taste.

thus addressed. The young Octavius assumed the {oya
virilis in his fifteenth year, in 48 1›..c., before which event
this dedication, if genuine, must have been written. Sue-
tonius asserts that the Culex was composed in the poet's

sixteenth year (54 Rc.) 3 the dedication, however, may have
been inserted later.
