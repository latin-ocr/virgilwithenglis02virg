AENEID BOOK X

Evander’s name, by the wars ye have won, by my
hopes, now springing up to match my father's re-
nown—trust not to flight. 'Tis the sword must hew
a way through the foe. Where yonder mass of men
presses thickest, there your noble country calls you
back, with Pallas at your head. No gods press upon
us; mortals, by mortal foes are we driven3 we have
as many lives, as many hands as they. Lo! ocean
hems us in with mighty barrier of sea3 even now
earth fails our flight3 shall we seek the main or

Anchemolus of Rhoetus' ancient line, who dared

Daueus, most like in semblance, indistinguishable to
kindred, and to their own parents a sweet perplexity.
But a grim difference now has Pallas made between
you. For thy head, Thymber, had Evander’s sword
swept off; while thy severed hand, Larides, seeks its
master, and the dying fingers twitch and clutch
again at the sword.

deeds, the Arcadians are armed by mingled wrath
