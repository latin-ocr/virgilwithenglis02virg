AENEID BOOK VIII

gains ; but tree-branches nurtured them and the
huntsman's savage fare. First from heavenly Olym-

found a safe liiding-place.¹ Under his reign were
the golden ages men tell of: in such perfect peace he
ruled the nations; till little bylittle there crept in a
race of worse sort and duller hue, the frenzy of war,
and the passion for gain. Then came the Ausonian
host and the Sicanian tribes, and ofttimes the land of
Saturn laid aside her names) Then kings arose, and

of Italy have since called our river Tiber; her true
name ancient Albula has lost. Myself, from father-lund

valiant Romulus restored an Asylum, and, beneath a
chill took, the Lupercal, bearing after Arcadian wont
the name of Lycaean Pan. He shows withal the
wood of holy Argiletum, and calls the place to

mountains,” and connected with πλατύς, “ br0a‹l,'' and lacus,
“sidess’ ² cf. Ausonia, Hesperia, Oenotria, Italia.
