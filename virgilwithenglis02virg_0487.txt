LYDIA¹

I 13va you, ye fields and lovely meads, for this more
lovely that my lovely girl is yours: in silence she
sighs for my love. v You it is she now sees, with you
my Lydia plays, to you she now makes speech, on
you she now smiles with those dear eyes, and cons
my songs with voice subdued, and sings the while
those strains she was wont to sing into my ear.

8I envy you, ye ficlds3 ye will learn to love. O
fields, too happy, yea, much blest, in which she will
set her snowy footstcps, or with rosy fingers will
pluck the green grape (for not yet swells the little
vine with sweet juice), or amid varied flowers, tribute
to Venus, she will lay down her limbs and crush the
tender grass, and apart by herself will stealthily re-
count the tale of my love. The woods will rejoice, the
soft meadows and cool springs will rejoice, and the
birds will make a silence. The gliding brooks will
pause (stay, ye watcrs!) till my beart sets forth its
sweet complaints.

¹ This seubimental lamen&l is independenb of the Dirae, but
came to bo associated with that poem because the name
“ Lydia '' is common to both compositions, 473
