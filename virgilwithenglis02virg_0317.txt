AENEID BOOK XII

behalf, I pray, resign, and suffer me to barter death
for fame.l I too, sire, can scatter darts and no weak·
ling steel from this right hand, and from my wounds
too flows blood. Far from him will be his goddess-
mother to shelter the runaway, woman-like, with a
cloud, and to conceal herself in empty shadows.'’ 2

⁵⁴ But the queen, dismayed by the new terms of
conflict, wept, and clung to her fiery son, ready to
die: “ Turnus, by these my team, by aught of rever—
ence for Amata that yet may touch thy heart-——thou
art now our only hope, thou the comfort of my sad
old age; in thine hands are the honour and sover-
eignty of Latinus, on thee rests all our sinking
house-one boon I beg: forbear to fight the TrojanS.
What perils soever await thee in that comba'c of
thine, await me also, Turnus; with thee 1 will quit
this hateful light, nor in captivity see Aeneas as my
son.’' Lavinia heard her mother’s words, her burn-
ing cheeks steeped in tears, while a deep blush
kindled its fire, and mantled o'er her glowing face.
As when one stains Indian ivory with crimson dye,
or as when white lilies blush with many a blended
rose—such hues her maiden features showed. Him

⁷2 “Nay, I beseech thee, not with tears, not
with such omen, as Ι pass to stern war’s
conflicts, do thou send me forth, O my mother-3
nor truly has Turnus freedom to delay his death.
Idmon, be my herald and bear this my message to
the Phrygian king—message he will not welcome:
soon as to-morrow’s Dawn, riding in crimson car,

where, however, Apollo and Poseidon reseue him in a cloud
