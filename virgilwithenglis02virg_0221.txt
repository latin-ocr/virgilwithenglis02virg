AENEID BOOK X

Against them storms the Dardan. His sword had
lopped off Anxur's left arm with all the circle of the
shield——he had uttered some brave vaunt and
thought his hand would match his word, and per-
chance lifted his soul heaven-high and promised
himself hoary eld and length of years—when, in the
pride of gleaming arms, Tarquitus, whom the Nymph
Dryope had borne to silvan Faunus, crossed his fiery
course. Drawing back his spear, he pins the corslet
and the shield's huge burden together3 then, as the
youth vainly pleaded and is fain to say many a word,
he dashes his head to the ground, and as he spurns 'che
trunk, yet warm, above him speaks thus from pitiless
heart t “ Lie now there, thou terrible one 1 No loving
mother shall lay thee in earth, nor load thy limbs
with ancestral tomb. To birds of prey shalt thou be
left3 or, sunl< beneath the flood, the wave shall bear
thee on, and hungry fish shall suck thy wounds.''
Next he o’ertakes Antaeus and Lucas, foremost of
Turnus’ ranks, and brave Numa, and tawny Camers,
son of noble Volcens, who was wealthiest in the land
of the Ausonians, and reigned over silent Amyclae.
Even as Aegaeon, who, men say, had a hundred arms
and a hundred hands, and flashed fire from fifty mouths
and breas'cs, what time against Jove’s thunders he
clanged with as many like shields, and bared as many
swords31 so Aeneas o'er the whole plain gluts his
victorious rage, when once his sword grew wal-111.
Nay, see! he turns upon Niphaeus’ four-horse car
and his opposing front3 and lo! when they mark his
long strides and deadly rage, in terror they turn,
and, rushing backwa1·d,fling forth their master and
whirl the ehariot to the shore.
