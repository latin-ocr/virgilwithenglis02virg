opposing fields: let brooks from all sides rush in
with deep-cleaving waters, nor let them suffer our
lands to be enslaved to vagabonds!”

⁷¹ This sweeter sti-ain, O Battarus, I remember
thou didst recall:

“ Let marshes from parched ground suddenly spring
forth, and, where once we gathered corn-ears, le't
this man reap rushes3 let the croaking frog sour the
chirping cricke’c’s hollow lairs 1 '¹

⁷5 This sadder sti-ain my pipe gives forth in turn:

“From high mountains let rains rush streaming
down, and with ouispread flood widely possess the
plains3 then with menace of evil to their lox-ds let
them leave stagnant pools! When the wave, gliding:
down, reaches my fields, then le’c the sti-anger plough-
man fish within my bounds-—the stranger, who has
ever waxed rich through citizens condemned ἱ ”

⁸² O ye fields acciu-sed, ye that the praetors have
condemned! and thou, O Discord, ever the foe oi
righteous citizens! I, a needy exile, though uncon-
demned, have left my fields, that a soldier may receive
the wages of deadly war. From this mound will 1
look my last upon my lands 3 from this will I pass to
the woods; soon will the hills, soon will 'che mount-
ains impede my view, but the plains will be able to
hear:

“Sweet lands, farewell! and thou, Lydia, sarewell,
sweeter than they, and ye, pure fountains, and ye
fields of happy name! ''

⁹1 Ah Ξ more slowly come down from the hill, ye
poor she—goats: never again shall ye browse on 'che
soft pastures that ye know so well; and do thou, sire
of the flock, stay behind ! Lo, upon the plains, my
first and last possession, I gaze ε long must I be rest
of them!
