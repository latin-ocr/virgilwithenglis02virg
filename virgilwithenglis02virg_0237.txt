AENEID BOO K X

flank——Ant01·es‚ comrade of Hercules, who, sent
from Argos, had cloven to Evander, and settled in
an Italian town. He falls, alas! by a wound meant
for another, and gaus on the sky, and dy mg, dreams
of his sweet Αι omos 'lhen good Aeno ts c xsts a spe n·· ‚
through the hollow shield of thxeefold b1 1-ss,th10ugh
the linen fo1ds, ·1nd inwoven woxk of {liple bull-
hides, it sped, and sank low 1n the «moin, >ct c···n¹ied
not home its strength. Quickly Aeneas, gladdened
by the sight of the Tusc·1n's bloozh snatehcs his
sword from the thigh and presses hotly on his hc-
wildcred foe. Deeply Lausus groaned for love of his
dear sire, when he saw the sight, and tears rolled
down his face.

⁷91 And here death’s cruel gloom and thy most
glorious dcedsaeif so be that ancient days may win
credence for such prowess-—I in south will not leave
unsung, nay, nor thyself, Ο youth, so worthy to be
sung!

⁷⁰4 The father, disabled and enmnnbcred, was now
giving ground with retreating steps, truiling from his
buckler his foeman's lance. Forth (lashcd the youth
and plunged into the f1·ay; and even as Aeneas'
hand rose to deal the blow, he caught up the hero's
point and stayed him by this chcck. His connndes
follow with loud eries, until the father, guarded by
his son’s shicld, might withdraw; and showering
their javelins beat back the foe with missiles from
afar. Aeneas, infnriate, keeps himself under shelter.
And as when at times storln-clouds pour down in
showers of hail, every ploughman, every husbandman
flees the fields, and the wayfare1‘·cowe1·s in safe
stronghold, be it river's bank οι· vault of lofty rock,
while the rain falls upon the lands, that so, when
the sun returns, they may pursue the day‘s taak:
