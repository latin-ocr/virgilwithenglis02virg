AENEID BOOK X

course a band of his own company meets him, for
the nymphs whom gracious Cybele had bidden be
deities of the sea, and turn from ships to nymphs,
came swimming alu-east and cleaving the billows, as
many as the brazen prows that once lay mom-ed to
shore. They know their king from afar, and encircle
him with dances. From among them, Cymodocea,
who was most skilled in speech, following behind,
grasps the stern with her right hand, and herself
rises breast high above the wave, while with her left
hand she oars her way upon the silent waters. Then
thus she accosts the prince, all unaware: “Wakest
thou, Aeneas, scion of gods? Wake and fling loose
the sheets of thy sails. NVe-—pines of Ida, from her
sacred erest, now nymphs of the sea—are thy fleet!
When the traitorous Rutulian was driving us head-
long with fire and sword, reluctant we broke thy
bonds, and are seeking thee over the main. This new
shape the Great Mother gave us in pity, and granted
us to be goddesses and spend our life beneath the
waves. But thy boy Ascanius is hemmed in by wall and
trench, in the midst of arms and of Latins, bristling
with war. Already the Arcadian horse, joined with
brave Etruscans, hold the appointed place3 to bar
their way with interposing squam-ons, lest they ap-
proach the camp, is Turnus’ fixed resolve. Up‚ then,
and with the coming dawn first bid thy friends be
called to arms, and take thou the shield which the
Lord of Fire himself gave thee—the shield invinci-
ble, and rimmed about with gold. To-morrow’s
light, it thou deem not my words idle, shall look on
mighty heaps of Rutulian cal-nage.” She ended, and
at parting, with her right hand she drove the tall
ship on, well knowing how; on it speeds over the
wave, fleeter than javelin and wind-swift arrow.
