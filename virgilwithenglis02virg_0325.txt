AENEID BOOK X11

mcestral Sun31 while Turnus comes behind a snow-
white pair, his hand brandishing two spears with
broad heads of steel. On this side father Aeneas,
source of the Roman stock, ablaze with starry shield
and celestia} arms, and, close by, Ascanius, second
hope of mighty Rome, issue from the camp; while in
spotless raiment a priest has brought the young of a
bristly boar and an unshorn sheep of two years old,
and set the beasts beside the blazing altars. The
heroes, turning their eyes to the rising sun, sprinkle
salted meal from their hands, mark the foreheads
of the victims with the knife,² and from goblets
pour libations on the altars. Then good Aeneas,
drawing his sword‚ thus makes prayer:

1⁷5 “ Now be the Sun witness to my call, and this
Earth, for whose sake 1 have been able to endure
such travails, and the Father Almighty, and thou his
consort, Saturnia—now kindlier, now at last, I pray, O
goddess: and thou, famed Mavors, thou the sire that
wieldest all warfare under thy sway3 and on Founts
and Floods I call, on all the majesty of high heaven
and powers that tenant the blue seas: if haply vic-
tory fall to Turnus the Ausonian, ’tis agreed that the
vanquished withdraw to Evander's city. Iulus shall
quit the soil; nor ever in after-time shall the sons of
Aeneas return for renewed war, or attack this realm
with the sword. But if Victory grant that the battle
be ours—as I rather deem, and so rather may the
gods confirm it with their power !-1 will not bid the
Italians be subject to Teucrians, nor do 1 seek the
realm for mine; under equal terms let both nations‚
unconquered, enter upon an everlasting compact.

¹ Latinus was deseended from the Sun through Circe,
mother of Faunus.
