AENEID BOOK VII

lock: “Is it to exiled Teucrians Lavinia is given as
wife, Ο father? and hast thou no pity on thy daugh-
ter and thyself? no pity on her mother, whom with
the first North wind the faithless pirate will desert,
steering for the deep with a maid as booty? Or,
was it not thus that the Phrygian shepherdl entered
Lacedaemon and bore off Leda’s Helen to Trojan
towns? What of thy solemn pledge? What of thine
old love for thine own, and the hand so oft pledged
to Turnus, thy kin? If for Latins a son be sought
of strangers’ stock, and if that be fixed, and the com-
mands of thy sire Faunus weigh upon thee, then I
hold that every land, free and separate from our rule,
is strange, and that such is the word of the gods.
Turnus, too, if the first origin of his house be traced
back, has ancestry in Inachus and Acrisius and mid-
most Mycenae.'' 2

the luckless queen, stung by monstrous horrors, in
wild frenzy rages from end to end of the city. As
at times a top, spinning under the twisted lash,
which boys intent on the game drive in a great circle
through an empty court—urged by the whip it
speeds on round after round3 the puzzled‚ childish
throng hang over it in wonder, marvelling at the
whirling box-wood; the blows give it life: so, with
course no slacker, is she driven through the midst of
cities and proud peoples. Nay, feigning the spirit
of Bacchus, essaying a greater sin and launching a

Ardea, and married Pilumnus. Mycenae is regarded as in
the centro of Greece‚
