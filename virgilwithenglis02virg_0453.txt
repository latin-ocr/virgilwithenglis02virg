rivalry by Greeks of every reahn, wherever the
winding Hellespont1 embraces his lands. I am she,
O Minos, whom by sacred compact thou didst call
wife: this thou hearest, albeit thou payest no heed.
Shall Ι in bonds float o’er the waves of so vast a
sea? In bonds shall I be suspended for so many
days, each following each? Yet that I aln worthy of
other punishment Ι may not plead, secing that thus
Ι surrendered my motherland and my deal· home to
foemen and to a tyrant—though I knew it not--thus
pitiless. Yet shame so foul as this methought my
countrymen might work me, should some mischance
first disclose our alliance, and when their city walls
were razed Ι, 011161 0116, alas! assailed their shrines
with flames3 but if thou wert victor, I deenied that
the stars would change their courses ere thou shouldst
do such deed 10 1116, thy captive. Now, now ’tis
wickedness that conquers all Ξ 2 Did I, forlorn one,

thee? Yet 'tis not strange. A maiden, deceived
by thy face———as I saw, how was Ι lost! how a
fatal frenzy swept 1116 awayl3—I did not (leem
that from that form of thine such guilt could spring.
With thy beauty thou wouldst deceive even the
stars!

——rich in frail coral and amber tears——was moved not
by damsels of like youth and beauteous to behold;
no sear of gods with its menace could hold me back:
Love conquered all: for what could Love not conquer?
