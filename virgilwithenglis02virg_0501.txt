Sne, of whom I have often told you, has come3
but, Tucca, one may not see her. She’s kept in
hiding‚ bai-red within her husband's threshold. She,
of whom I have often told you, has not yet come to
me, for if slie‘s kept in hiding, what one ean’t touch
is far away. Suppose she has come3 I have heard
it. But now what good is that news to me? Tell it
to him, sor whom she has come back.

Ιτ’3 Corinthian words the fellow adores, that sorry
rhetorician! For, perfect Thucydides that he is, he

gram as a piece of conversation or fragment of 3 letter, all of
it the utterance of the poet. The verb of saying 13 omitted
in lines 1 and 3, as often in the epistolary style. The lady
referred to is not named. In the last two lines the poet
turns away from Tueca to address those who have brought
him news of the lady's return. This, he implies, is 3 matter
of perfect indifference to him.

² This epigram is discussed by tho translator in the Trans-
actions of the American Philoloyical Associatffin, vol. xlvii„
1916, pp. 43 ff. The person assailed 13 Τ. Annius Cimber, a
rhetorician who 13 said to have murdered 1113 brother. In his
rhetoric he was 311 Atticist, following Thucydides, who in
his History has given so vivid a description of the Attio
plague (11. 47-54). The writer uses verba in 3 double sense,
“ words '' and ‘⁴ spells‚'’ and Corinthiorum implies “ archaia ''
or ‘⁸ obsolete‚” involving an allusion to old bronzes 33 well 33
to Medea’s poisons. In Gallicum there 13 an implied refer·
enee to the name Cimber, and tau suggests some peculiarity
of pronunciation. Cimber, who wrote in Greek, evidently
used the Ionio μίν and the tragio σφίν. As, then, for his
pupils he mingled these uncouth sounds, so for his brother
he concocted deadly speIIS.
