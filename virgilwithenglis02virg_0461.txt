CIRIS

⁶²0 Yet even this not without penalty: for the king
of the gods, who with his power sways all regions of
the world, being grieved that a maid so wicked
should be flitting to the world above, while under
dark night’s cover her father’s light was quenched,
unto him by reason of his piety (for oft with the
blood of sleek bulls had he suppliantly besprinkled
the altars, and oft with lavish gifts had he adorned
the homes of the gods) granted under changed form
the life he had craved, and suffered him to be on
earth a winged sea—eagle, for in lightning-swift eagles
that god ever delights. But upon that unhappy maid,
since she had first been condemned by judgmen’c of
the godS‚ of fate and of her husband,1 he laid an
angry father's relentless hate. For even as, amid
the grandeur of heaven's constellations, the glorious
Scorpion, which alone Ι have seen bestarred with
two-sold brilliance, puts to rout in alternate strise
the gleaming Orion: so the sea-engle and the Ciris,
with ever remindful fate, maintain the fiercencss ot
mutual wrath from age to age. Wherever she flees,
cleaving the light air with her wings‚ lo ἶ savage and
ruthlcss, with loud whirr Nisus follows through the
sky ; where Nisus mounts skyward, she flees in haste,
cleaving the light air with her wings.‘-'
