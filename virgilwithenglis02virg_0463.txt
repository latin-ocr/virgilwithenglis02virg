COPA ²

SvmscA, the inn-keeper, her head bound with Greek
kerchief, trained as she is to sway her tremulous
limbs to the notes of her castanets, within her smoky
tavern tipsily dances in wauton wise, shaking against
her elbow her noisy reeds : 2 “ What boots it to stay
outside, when aweary with the summer’s dust, rather
than to recline on the thirsty conch of grass? ³ There
are garden nooks and arbours, mixing-eups, roses,
flutes, lyres, and cool bowers with shady canes. Lo!
too, the pipe,whieh twitters sweetly within a Maena-
lian4 grotto, sounds its rustic strain in a shepherd's
mouth. There is fresh wine, too, just drawn from
the pitched jar, and 3 water-brool< running noisily
with hoarse murmur; there are also chaplets of
violet blossoms mixed with saffron, and yellow gar-
lands blended with crimson roses3 and 111165 bedewed
by a virgin stream, which a nymph ⁵ has brought in
osier-baskets. There are little cheeses, too, dried in
abasket of rushes; there are waxen plums of autumn’s
season, and chestnuts and sweetly blushing apples;
there is Ceres’ pure gift, with Love and Bacchus;

¹ This interesting little poem, written in elegiae couplets,
was attributed to virgil by the grammarian Charisius.

² The castanets were made of pieces of reed 01· wood.
