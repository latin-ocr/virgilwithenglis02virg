unable to pass, whether he had to raee to Mantua or
to Brixia. And this, says he, the noble house of his
rival, Trypho, does not deny; nor the lodging-rooms
of Caerulus, where he who afterwards was Sabinus,
out ere that Quinctio, tells that with two-bladed
shears he once clipped the hairy necks, lest, under
the pressure of Cytorian yoke‚l the harsh mane
might cause some soreness.

1² O cold Cremona and muddy Gaul, Sabinus says
that this was and is well-known to thee: he claims
that from his earliest birthtime he stood in thy mire,
in thy marsh laid by his packs, and thence over so
many miles of rutty roads bore the yoke, whether
the mule on left or on right or on both sides began
to flag . . .; and that no vows to the gods of the
by-ways were made by him save this at the last—-
his father’s reins and the curry-eomb close by.2

²⁴ But these things are past and gone ; now he sits
in his ivory chair and dedicates himself to thee, twin
Castor, and to thee, Castor’s twin-brother.
