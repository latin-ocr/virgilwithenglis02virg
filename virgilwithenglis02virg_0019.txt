AENEID BOOK Vll

Marica. Faunus’ sire was Picus, and he boasts thee,
O Saturn, as his father; thou art first founder of the
line. To him by Heaven’s decree was no son or
male desc-ent, cut off, as it was, in the spring of early
youth. Alone, to preserve the house and noble home,
was a daughter, now ripe for a husband, now of full
age to be a bride. Many wooed her from wide
Latium and all Ausonia, yet goodliest above all other
wooers was Turnus, of long and lofty aneestnv, whom
the queen-mother yearned with wondrous passion to
unite to her as son. But divine portents, with mani-
fold alarms, bar the way. In the midst of the palace,
in the high inner courts, stood a laurel of sacred
leafage, preserved in awe through many years, which
lord Latinus himself, 'twas said, found and dedicated
to Phoebus, when he built his first towers; and from
it he gave his settlers their name Laurentes. Atop
of this tree, wondrous to tell, settled a deuse sav-arm
of bees, borne with loud humming· across the liquid
air, and with feet intertwined hung· in sudden swarm
from the leafy bough. Forthwith the prophet eries:
“I see a stranger draw near3 from the self-same
quarter a troop seeks the same quan-ter, and reigns
in the topmost eitadel ! '' Moreover, while with hal-
lowed torch he kindles the altars, and at her father's
side stands the maiden Lavinia, she was seen (O hor-
ror !) to catch fire in her long tresses, and burn with
crackling flame in all her headgear, her queenly hair
ablaze, ablaze her jewelled coronal; then wreathod
in smoke and yellow glare, she scattered sire through-
out the palace. That indeed was noised abroad as
an awfnl and wondrous vision ; for she, they foretold,
would herself be glorions in fame and fortune, yet
to her people she boded a mighty war.
