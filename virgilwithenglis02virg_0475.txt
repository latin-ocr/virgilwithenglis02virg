ments lose their peculiar strength ; the many colours
blend into one, yet neither is this wholly green, for
milk-white fragments still resist, nor is it a shining
milky—white, for it is varied by so many herbs.
Often the strong odour smites the man’s open
nostrils, and with wrinkled nose he condemns his
breakfast fare, often drawing the back of his hand
across his tearful eyes, and cursing in anger the
innocent smoke.

111 The work goes on apace: no longer in uneven
course, as before, but heavier in weight, the pestle
moves on in slower circles. Therefore he lets fall
upon it some drops of Minerva's oil, pouring o‘er it
strong vinegar in scanty stream, then once more
stirs up the dish and handles the mixture afresh.
And now at length he passes two fingers round all
the mortar, and into one ball packs the sundry pieres,
so that, in reality as in name, there is fashioned a

forth the bread, which he gladly welcomes to his
hands; and now that sear of hunger is driven away,
care-free for the day, Simylus dons his well-matched
leggings and sheltering cap, forces his submissive
bullocks under their leather-bound yokes, and drives
them to the ficlds, there in the earth burying his
plough.

¹ Thus is designated the rustic dish of herbs, which forms
the subject of this curious sketch. Another reference to the
moretum in Latin literature is in ovid, Fasti, lv. 367, where

we learn that the mixture was used at the feasts of Cybele.
A prose description is given in Columella (xu. 57).
