CATALEPTON

IX¹

Som: few thoughts, few but not unknown to shining
Phoebus, impart to me, ye learned Muses!

3 A conqueror comes—lo! the mighty glory of a
mighty triumph—conqueror he, where’er lands and
where’er seas are outspread, bearing grim tokens
of barbaric strife, like unto Oeneus’ mighty son,‘-'
or unto proud Eryx; nor less on that account most
mighty in drawing forth your songs and worthy to
enter your holy choirs. Therefore, noblest of men,
the more am Ι fretted with unwonted cares, wonder·
ing what about thee or what for thee I have power
to pen. For that which—yea, I will avow it—ought
to have been chief reason for holding me back, has
been chief reason for urging me along.

¹3 Some few of thy songs have found place 111 my
pages 3—songs of Attic speech as well as Attic wit
—songs that, welcomed by ages yet to be, are worthy
to outlive the aged Phrygian‚⁴ worthy to outlive the
aged man of Pylos-'³ Herem, under a spreading oak’s
green covert, were the shepherds Moeris and Meli-
boeus at their ease, throwing off in alternate verse
sweet songs such as the learned youtl1⁶ of Sicily loves.
Emulously all the gods graced the heroine;⁷ emu-
lously the goddesses graced her with their several
gifts.

¹¹¹ Meleager: or possibly Diomedes, son of Tydeus and
grandson of Oeneus.

Messalla’s into Latin. ⁴ l‘riam.
⁶ Nestor, who in the Homeric narrative is living in the
third generation of men. ⁶ Theocritus.

⁷ Probably Sulpicia, daughter of tho orator Servius
