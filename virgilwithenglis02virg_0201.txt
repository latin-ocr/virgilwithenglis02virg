AENEID BOOK X

Then the rest quicken their speed. Mat-velling, the
Trojan son of Anchises is in amaze, yet cheers his
soul with the omen. Then looking at the vault
above, he briefly prays: “Gracious lady of Ida,
mother of the gods, to whom Dindymus is dear, and

baneful wise3 or even as fiel-y Sirius, that bearer of
drought and pestilence to feeble mortals, rises and
saddens the sky with baleful light.
