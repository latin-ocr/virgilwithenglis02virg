AENEID BOOK X

²⁷⁶ Yet fearless Turnus lost not the firm hope, to
seize the shore first, and drive the coming foe from
land. “What in your prayers ye have craved, ye
now may do—break through with the sword! The
war-god’s self is in brave men's hands ll Now let
each be mindful of his wife and home3 now recall
the great deeds, the glories of our sires! Let us on
and meet them at the water's edge, while they are
confused, and their feet salter, as first they land.
Fortune aids the daring.'' So saying, he ponders
with himself whom to lead to the attack, or to whom
he may entrust the beleaguered walls.

28⁷ Meanwhile Aeneas lands his crews from the
tall ships by gangways. Many watch for the ebb of
the spent sea, and boldly leap into the shallows;
others use oars. Tarchon, marking the shore where
the shallows heave not nor the broken billow roars,
but the sea, unchecked, glides up with spreading
flow, suddenly turns his prows thither and implores
his men: “ Now, O chosen band, bend to your stout
oars! Uplift, drive on your l›arques; cleave with
your beaks this hostile shore, and let the keel her-
self plough a furrow. In such resting-place Ι shrink
not from shipwreck, so but once I win the land.”
When Tarchon has thus spoken, his comrades rise
on to their oars, and drive their foaming ships upon
the Latin fields, till the beaks gain the dry land and
every hull comes to rest unscathed. But not thy
ship, Tarchon; for while, dashing amid the shallows,
she hangs upon an uneven ridge, long poised in
doubtful balance, and wearies the waves, she breaks
up and plunges her crew amid the billows. Broken
oars and floating thwarts entangle them, while the
ebbing wave sucks back their feet.

itself) is in your hands 1'’ 191
