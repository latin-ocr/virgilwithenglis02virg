AENEID BOOK IX

sent to Troy in forbidden arms, lightly accoutred
with naked sword and white shield, as yet unfamed.1
Soon as he saw himself in the midst of Turnus’ thou-
sands, the Latin lines standing on this side, and
standing on that, like a wild beast that, hedged
about by the hunters' serried ring, rages against
their shafts, flings itself on the death foreseen‚
and with a bound springs upon the spears—even so
the youth rushes to death amidst the foe, and where
he sees the weapons thickest, makes his way. But
Lycus, far swifter of foot, amid foes, amid arms,
gains the walls and strives to clutch the coping‚ and
reach the hands of his comrades. Him Turnus fol-
lowing alike with foot and spear, taunts thus in
triumph: “Fool, didst thou hope to escape our
hands? '¹ Therewith he seizes him as he hangs, and
tears him down with a mighty mass of wall : even as
when the bearer of Jove’s bolt, as he soars alost, has
swept away in his crooked talons some hare or snowy-
bodied swa11; or as when the wolf of Mars2 has
snatched from the fold a lamb that its mother seeks
with much bleating. On all sides a shout goes up3

trenches; some toss blazing brands on to the roofs.
Ilioneus lays Lucetius low with a rock, huge frag-
ment of a mountain, as, carrying flre, he nears the
gate. Liger slays Emathion, Asilas Corynaeus ; the
one skilled with the javelin‚ the other with the
arrow stealing from afar. Caeneus fells Ortygius;
Turnus victorious Caeneus; Turnus Itys and Clonius,
Dioxippus and Promolus, and Sagaris, and Idas, as he
stood on the topmost towers; Capys slays Privernus.

² Because Romulus and Remus, the offspring of Mars,
were suckled by a she-wolf.
