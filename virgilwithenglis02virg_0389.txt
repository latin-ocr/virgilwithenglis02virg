but 'tis her joy that her gentle songs run with slender
foot, and sport, under Phoebus' guidance, as befits
her strength. This 5116 sings for thee, holy youth;

for all time, and abiding throughout the ages; for

and as thy due may there be recorded a life pre-
served through happy years, shining for the joy of
the good ! But let me pass to my emprise.

heaven’s heights,l and from gilded car was scattering
his gleaming rays, and Dawn with roseate locks had
routed darkness, when a shepherd drove forth his
goats from their folds to the joyous pastures, and
sought a lofty mountain’s highest ridges, where pale
grasses clothed the spreading slopes. As they roam,
they hide themselves now in 1116 woods and thickets,

pliant willow, or of fresh growing alder3 this gropes
amid the thickets’ tender briars, while that hangs
over the water of the stream, its wondrous mirror.

cares know not, that rend greedy hearts within
