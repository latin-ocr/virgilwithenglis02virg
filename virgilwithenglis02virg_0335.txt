AENEID BOOK XII

smites his side with unyielding sword. Podalirius,
pursuing with naked steel, overhangs the shepherd
Alsus, as in foremost line he rushes amid the dai-ts;
but Alsus, swinging back his axe, severs full in
front his enemy’s brow and chin, and drenches his
armour with widely spattered gore. Stern repose
and iron slumber press upon his eyes, and their orbs

man he tumbles half-slain, or crushes whole ranks
beneath his car, or, seizing spear after spear, showers
them upon the fugitives. Even as when, at full
speed, by the streams of icy Hebrus blood-stained
Mavors thunders with his shield, and, rousing war,
gives rein to his frenzied steeds; they o’er the open

plain outstrip the South wind and the West3 utmost
