he calls for his steeds, and joys to see them neighing
before his face—the steeds that Orithyia's self gave as
a glory to Pilumnus, for that they excelled the snows

wear sword and shield and the horns of his ruddy
erest ¹ ; the sword the divine Lord of Fire had himself
wrought for his father Daunus and dipped, all glow-
ing, in the Stygian wave. Theu, his mighty spear,
which stood leaning upon a giant column amid the
hall, he seizes with strong hand, spoil of Auruncan
Actor, and shakes it quivering, while he eries aloud:
“ Now, O spear, that never failed my call, now the
hour is come! Thee mighty Actor once bore; thee

the corslet of this Phrygian eunuch, and to deffle in
dust his looks, crisped with heated iron and be-
drenched in myrrh!” Such is the frenzy driving
him: from all his face shoot fiery sparks; his eager
eyes flash flame—even as a bull, ere the battle
begins, awakes a fearful bellowing, and, essaying,
to throw wrath into his horns, charges a tree's trunk;
he lashes the winds with his blows, and paws the
sand in prelude for the fray.2
