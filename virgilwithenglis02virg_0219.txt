AENEID BOOK X

fiercely drives with the steel a broad path through
the host, secking thee, Turnus, still flushed with
new-wrought slaughter. Pallas, Evander, all stands
before his eyes—the board whereto 116 then came
first, a stranger, and the right hands pledged.
Then, four youths, sons of Sulmo, and as many
reared by Ufens, he takes alive, to offer as victims to
the dead and to sprinkle the funeral flame with cap-
tive blood. Next at Magus from afar he had aimed
the hostile lance. Deftly he cowers——the lance flies
quivering o’er him—and, clasping the hero’s knees,
he speaks thus in suppliance: “ By the spirit of thy
father, by thy hope in growing Iiilus, I entreat thee,
save this life for a son and for a sire. A stately
house have 13 buried deep within 116 talents of
chased silver, and mine are masses of gold, wrought
and unwrought. Not on me turns the victory of
Troy, nor will 0116 life make differenee so great.’'
He spoke, and Aeneas thus replied: “Those many
talents of silver and gold thou tellest of, spare for
thy sons. Such trafficking in war Turnus first put
away, even in the 110111 when Pallas was slain. Thus
judges my father Anchises’ spirit, thus Iiilns.’' So
speaking, 116 grasps the helmet with 1115 left hand,
and bending back the suppliant‘s neck, drives the
sword up to the hilt. Hasd by was Haemon's son,
priest of Phoebus and Trivia, his temples wreathed
in the fillet's sacred band, all glittering in his robe
and in resplendent arms. Him he meets and drives
over the plain3 then, bestriding the fallen, slaughters
him and wraps him in mighty darkness3 his armour
Serestus gathers and carries away on his shoulders, a

trophy, King Gradivus, unto thee!
⁵⁴¹³ Caeculus, born of Vulcan's racc, and Umbro,
who comes from the Μαι-51311 111115, repair the ranks.
