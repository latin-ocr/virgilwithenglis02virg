BOOK VIII

Soou as Turnus raised up the flag of war from
Laurentum's citadel‚ and the horus rang with their
hoarse notes, soon as he roused his fiery steeds and
clashed his arms, straightway men's hearts were
troubled; all Latium at once is leagued in startled
uprising, and her sons rage madly. The chief cap-
tains, Messapus and Ufens, with Mezentius, scorner
of the gods, from all sides muster forces and strip
the wide fields of husbandmen. Venulus too is sent
to mighty Diomede's city1 to seek aid, and announce
that Teucrians set foot in Latium3 that Aeneas is
come with his fleet, bringing to thern his vanquished
gods, and proclaiming himself a king summoned by
Fate ; that many tribes are joining the Dardan hero
and his name spreads far and wide in Latium.
What end he compasses with these beginnings, what
outcome of the feud he craves, should Fortune attend
him, would be more clearly seen by Diomede’s seli
than by King Turnus or King Latinus.²

1⁸ Thus it was throughout Latium. And the hero
of Laomedon's line, seeing it all, tosses on a mighty
sea of troubles; and now hither, now thither he
swiftly throws his mind, easting it in diverse ways,
and turning it to every shist; ·⁸ as when in brazen

¹ Argyripa or Arpi, in Apulia.
²Knowing the Trojans as he did, Diomede could judge

best as to their plans ¹and aspiratione.
