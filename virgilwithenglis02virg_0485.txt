DIRAE

“Once more, ye fields, farewess, and fare thee
well, good Lydia; whether thou wilt live, or not, in
either case thou wilt die with me ! ''

⁹⁷ Our last strain, O Battarus, let us recall on the
reed!

“Sweet shall become bitter, and soft hard3 eyes
shall see white as black, and right as left3 atoms
of things shall pass into bodies of other kinds, ere
regard for thee pass from my heart.1 Though fire,
though water thou shalt be, ever will I love thee,
for ever will it be permitted to think upon thy
joys Ξ ”

² By casus rerum he means the dissolution of things 3 hence
the atoma of a body, which, when reunited, form objeets of

a different kind. This is therefore a reference to the atomio
theory of the Epicureans.
