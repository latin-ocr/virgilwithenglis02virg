AENEID BOOK VII

pouring his stream from an embossed urn.¹ Behind
him comes a cloud of infantry, and shielded columns
bhrong all the plain, Argive manhood and Auruncan
hands, Rutulians and old Sicanians, the Sacranian
lines and Labicians with painted bucklers3 they who
till thy glades, O Tiber, and Numicius' sacred shore,
whose ploughshare moves the Rutulian hills and
Circe's ridge²; o’er whose fields Jupiter of Anxur
reigns, and Feronia rejoicing in her g1·eenwood;
where lies Satura's black marsh, and cold Ufens
winds his way through the valley-depths and sinks
into the sea.

⁸⁰³ To crown the array comes Camilla, of Volscian
race, leading her troop of horse, and squadrons gay
with brass,——a warrior-maid, never having trained
her woman’s hands to Minerva’s distaff or basket of
wool, but hardy to bear the battle-bruni: and in
speed of foot to outstrip the winds. She might
have flown o’er the topmost blades of unmown corn,
nor in her course bruised the tender ears; or sped
her way o'er mid sea, poised above the swelling
wave, nor dipped her swift feet in the flood. All
the youth, streaming from house and field, and
thronging matrons marvel, and gaze at her as she
,goes3 agape with wonder how the glory of royal
purple drapes her smooth shoulders; how the clasp
entwines her hair with gold; how her own hands
bear a Lyeian quiver and the pastoral myrtle tipped
with steel.

¹ The river Inachus is represented by a figure of the river-
god, pouring water from an urn. ² cs. 10 above.
