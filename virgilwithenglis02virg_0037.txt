AENEID BOOK VII

what yawning Charybdis? They find shelter in
Tiber's longed-for channel, careless of ocean and of
me. Mars could destroy the Lapiths’ giant race3
the very father of the gods yielded ancient Calydon
to Diana’s wrath31 though for what heinous sin did
Lapiths or Calydon merit such penalty? But Ι,
Jove's mighty consort, who have endured, alas! to
leave naught undared, who have turned me to every
shift, Ι am worsted by Aeneas! But if my powers
be not strong enough, surely I need not be slow to
seek succonr wherever it may be3 if Heaven I can
not bend, then Hell I will arouse! Not mine will
it be—-I grant it—to keep him from the crown of
Latium, and by fate Lavinia abides immovably his
bride; yet to put off the hour and to bring delay to
such great issues--that may 1 do; yet may Ι uproot
the nation of either king. At such price of their
people’s lives be father and son-in-law united ! Blood
of Trojan and Rutulian shall be thy dower, maiden,
and Bellona awaits thee as thy bridal man-on. Nor
did Cisseus’ daughter alone conceive a firebrand and
give birth to nuptial flames.·2 Nay‚ Venus has the
like in her own child, a second Paris, another funeral
torch for reborn Troy.’'

home of the Dread Goddesses and the infernal shades
—Allecto‚ whose heart is set on gloomy wars, pas-
sions, plots and baneful crimes. Hateful is the mon-
ster even to her sire Pluto, hateful to her Tartarean
sisters ; so many are the forms she assumes, so savage

¹ The wild boar of Calydon ravaged the land because
Oeneus, the king, had neglected sacrifico to Diana.

² Hecuba, before bearing Paris, dreamed that she would
give birth to a firebrand.
