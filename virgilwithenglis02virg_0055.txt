AENEID BOOK VII

many lands, the Vale of Ampsanctus. On either
hand a forest's fringe, dark with dense leafage,hems
it in, and in the centre a roal-ing torrent resounds
o’er the rocks in swirling eddies. Here is shown
an awful cavern, and a breathing-place of horrid
Dis ; and a vast gorge, whence Acheron bursts forth,
