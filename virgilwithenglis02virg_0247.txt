BOOK XI

MEANwfflLE dawn rose and left the ocean. Aeneas,
though his sorxous urge to give time fo1 his com-
rades’1›11rial,and death has beu ildercd his soul, >et
as the D· ·1y-star rose, began to pay the gods his xous
of victory.l A mighty oak, its branches iopped all
about, he plants on a mound, and arx-ays in the
gleaming arms stripped from Mezentius the chief, a
trophy to thee, thou Lot-d of War.2 Thereto he
fastens the crests dripping with blood, the soldier's
broken darts, and the brenstpiate smitten and piei-ced
twice six times; to the left hand he binds the brazen
shield, and from the neck hangs the ivory sword.
Then his triumphant comrades—for the whole band
of chieftains thronged close about him—he thus
begins to exhort.

14 “Mighty deeds have we wrought, my men: fm
what remains, away with all sear! These are the
spoils and firstfruits of a haughty king; and here is
Mezentius, as fashioned by my hands. Now lies our
march to Latium's king and walls. Prepare your
weapons with courage and with your hopes anticipate
the war; so that, soon as the. gods above grant us to
pluck hence our standai-ds, and from the camp to lead

Roman ritual; his inolination would have led him to bury
his comrades first.

2 In the trophy here described, the trec-brunk doubtless
represents the body of the vanquished foa.
