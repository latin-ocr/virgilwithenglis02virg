famous Athens. Now at a distance, rising from the
flood, the fields of Salamis she espies, lying apart
from the waves, and now she sees the shining
Cyclades: on this side the Venus of Sunium opens
to her; on that, opposite, Hermione’s town.1 Then
she leaves Delos, dearest beyond all to the mother
of the Nereids and to Aegean Neptune32 she sees
afar Cythnus, girt with foaming shore, and draws
near to marble-white Paros and green Donysa, with
Aegina and health-bringing Seriphus.3 Now at length
her strength flees from her weary frame, her head
falls back heavy on her bended neck, her marble-
white arms grow livid under the close-drawn knots.
Monsters of the sea, giant forms of the deep, throng
about her on all sides, and in the blue—grey waters
threaten her with lashing tails and gaping mouths.
Onward she moves, tossed to aud fro by uncertain
winds (even as a tiny skiff when it follows a great
fleet, and an African hurricane riots upon the wintry
sea) until Neptune’s spouse,4 queen of the azure
realm, brooked it not that such a beauteous form
should be harassed by the waves, and transformed
the maiden‘s hapless limbs. But still she purposed
not to clothe the gentle maid with scales for ever,
or establish her amid treacherous fishes (all too
greedy is Amphitrite’s flock): rather she raised her
aloft on airy wings, that she might live on earth as
Ciris, named from the deed wrought ⁵-Ciris, more
beauteous than Leda’s Amyclaean swan.

¹ The poet incorrectly substitutes Venus (Aphrodite) for
Athena, who had a temple on Cape Sunium. Hermione was
in the Argolid. ² cf. Aen. 111. 74.

³ An allusion, probably, to the story of Danae and Perseus,
whose ark was washed upon the coast of Seriphus.

⁴ Amphitrite.

‘⁵ Ciris is from κείρειν, “ eut²’ or “ ahear.”
