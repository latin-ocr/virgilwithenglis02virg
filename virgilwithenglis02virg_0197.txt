AENEID BOOK X

over his form the soft plumage of hoary eld, leaving
earth and seeking the stars with his cry. His son,
following on ship-board with a band of like age,
drives with oars the mighty Centaur3 over the water
towers the monster, and threatens to hurl a monstrous
rock into the waves froin above, while with long
keel he furrows the deep seas.

native shores, son of prophetie Manto and the Tuscan
river, who gave thee, O Mantua, ramparts and his
mother’s name—Mantua, rich in ancestry, yet not
all of one stock: three races are there, and under
each race four peoples:1 herself the head of the
peoples, her strength from Tuscan blood. Hence,
too, Mezentius arms five hundred against himself,2
whom Mincius, child of Benacus, crowned with gray
sedge, leads over the seas in their hostile ships of
pine. On comes Aulestes heavily, lashing the waves
as he rises to the stroke of a hundred oars3 the
waters foam as the suri'ace is uptorn. He sails in
the huge Triton, whose sheli affrights the blue billows:
its shaggy front, as it floats, shows a man down to
the waist, its belly ends in a fish3 beneath the inon-
ster's breast the wave gui-gles in foam. So many the
chosen chiefs who sailed in thrice ten ships to the
succour of Troy, and cut the briny plains with brazen
beak.

215 And now day had passed from the sky and
gracious Phoebe was trampling mid-heaven with her
night-roving steeds; Aeneas, for care allows no rest
to his limbs, sat at his post, his own hand guiding
the rudder and tending the sails. And lo! in mid

cities (cs. Livy, v. 33), Mantua in the time of Pliny was the
only Tuscan city north of the Po.
